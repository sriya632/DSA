'''Problem statement
Ninja has been given two sorted arrays/lists, ‘ARR1’ and ‘ARR2’ of lengths ‘M’ and ‘N’ respectively. He is also provided with an integer ‘K’. He has to find the ‘K’th element (1 based indexing) in the sorted array/list of length ‘M + N’ made by merging ‘ARR1’ and ‘ARR2’.
For example :
‘ARR1’ = {1, 4, 6, 7} 
‘ARR2’ = {2, 3, 5, 6} 
‘K’ = 6

So the sorted array after merging ‘ARR1’ and ‘ARR2’ will be:
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7}
So the 6th element (1 based indexing) is in the new sorted merged array/list is 6.
As Ninja is busy with the preparation of his upcoming exams so, he asks you for help. Can you help Ninja to solve this problem?
